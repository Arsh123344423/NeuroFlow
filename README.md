## 🚀 Overview
NeuroFlow Enterprise is an AI-powered orchestration layer designed to support neurodivergent professionals (ADHD, Autism, Dyslexia). By sitting on top of Microsoft 365, it intercepts complex workflows and restructures them into neuro-friendly formats, solving the "Executive Dysfunction" challenge in the modern workplace.

## ✨ Key Features
* **The De-Fogger:** An Outlook/Teams plugin that translates vague corporate jargon into clear, actionable checklists.
* **AI Body Double:** A persistent Azure Avatar companion that detects "task paralysis" and provides gentle verbal nudges to help users initiate work.
* **Meeting Sentinel:** Real-time transcription using Azure Speech that highlights social cues and explicit action items.
* **Dopamine Menu:** A gamified task dashboard that breaks projects into micro-steps to prevent cognitive overwhelm.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture
NeuroFlow uses a **"Rule of Two"** implementation to ensure enterprise scalability and technical sophistication.
